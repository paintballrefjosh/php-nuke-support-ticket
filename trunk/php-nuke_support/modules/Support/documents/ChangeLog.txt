ChangeLog
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saturday 21 August 2004 10:21:11
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
+	Released Version 1.8c - this fixes a lot of bugs and probably creates
	new ones - though the SMTP area has been vastly improved. Go to the
	Forum to leave comments please.

Sunday 01 August 2004 11:56:18
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
+	Changed the session names again to be more unique from other systems.
+	Changed some includes to include_once as this will not cause an error
	if trying to include the same file again.

Wednesday 28 July 2004 22:05:46
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
+	Changed the Session Idenifier for the Username and Password on the
	user side so it cant clash with the admin side.
+	Added clean to new tickets.

Saturday 24 July 2004 13:08:16
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
+	Added a cleaning function to stop tagged code going into the form
	boxes - so no-one can enter HTML or Javascript especially.
+	If magic quotes are off then need to use ADDSLASHES on the queries
	this may cause some issues in the short term of finding places where
	I may need to add them and then strip them. If you spot some errors
	in this then let me know please.
+	Found some cool javascript that places the focus on the first form
	element on any page. Great for dynamic pages with one header file.
+	Removed a lot of table border elements as now using CSS boxborder tag.
+	Added in different methods to send through, probably been causing most
	of the SMTP issues, now you can send through normal PHP mail, sendmail
	SMTP still and Qmail, just change the setting in the config.
+	Removed all comments on database calls so you can see more clearly whats
	going on when it errors.
+	Changed the way the buttons work with CSS - got rid of loads of code
	this way and made easier to change for users.
+	Removed the logo image and W3C image from the footer.
+	Removed ability to remove the footer - you will have to change the code
	now - Reason, too many people asking for help and promising some reward,
	then not donating and generally pissing me off. So I deserve a little
	back please :)

Tuesday 20 July 2004 19:15:08
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
+	Changed the upload paths to be a little more intuitive - should just
	have to change the DEMO folder to the folder on your domain.

	against the post - some items may open direct in the browser i.e. Word
	documents do these days.
+	Adjusted the stylesheet on the admin it was different to user side and
	created nasty borders.
+	Added the abiliy for the Users and Administrators to assign attachments
	to each individual post. Attachment can only happen at point of writing
	the post at present.
+	Max File size can be set in the Browser but please also check your PHP ini
	file to make sure File Uploads are allowed and that the max file size is
	set high enough to satisfy your needs.

	are allowed to be uploaded - administered in config file.

Tuesday 20 May 2003 10:03:13
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
+	Added in Urgency field in User/Admin responses.
+	Have added a Message trail within the emails sent out by the User/Admin.
	The user will now be able to look within the email at past responses.
	It will detail the person who wrote the ticket and the date and the message.
+	Tidied up the admin email a little - now posts the Subject and date
	in a better plain text format.
+	Added in the correct subjects to post performed by Users and by the
	Admins - this may aid tracking.
+	Added in a META REFRESH after the posting session has ended this will
	refresh the user to the Ticket View screen and if they hit refresh it
	will not try and repost the data. This has been done for both Admin
	and User sides. The refresh happens after 2 seconds so they should be
	able to see the success message.
+	Added in Delete and Edit Icons to the user admin. Currently only the
	delete one works as I dont hink it is too hard to enter in a new user
	anyways. I will get the edit function to work to display more info on
	the user also. There is now a Javascript prompt before you delete.

Sunday 04 May 2003 12:43:07
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
+	Added in the User Admin into the admin section - this will not list
	current users - enabling the administrator to suspend them without
	delay and Add new users to to the system. New users have a status of 1
	suspended users a status of 2 - only users with status 1 will be allowed
	to log into the site area.
+	Changed the way the admin is added - currently one administrator can be
	set and this is added within the config file. Change the username and
	password to anything you want - only this account will have access to
	the admin section. You will need to create yourself as a user to get into
	the users end.


Thursday 01 May 2003 11:55:17
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
+	Completed the admin element - so the Administrator can respond to all
	messages sent in.
+	Adding responses to tickets completed - Administrator emailed after
	each response id added. Now the opening page will be customer facing
	all responses added by the Administrator will be through the Admin
	there they will be able to see all the tickets produced by all there
	users.
+	NewRequest completed - a logged in user will be able to write a new
	request, the Administrator will be email the request.
+	Added in the AUTH system so I can identify users and there past posts
	made up a table to identify users, status will be 0-off 1-normal 2-admin
+	Started the application by building from the blocks of PHP-Multiple
	Newsletters - so the look and feel will be similar to that.
