ChangeLog:

v2.0 :: 01.31.2005
 - Module now uses the PHP-Nuke user database instead of a
   standalone user database. This makes it much easier on both the
   clients and the admins. Clients only have to have one account
   now instead of two :)

v1.0b :: 01.04.2005
 - First Release available!
